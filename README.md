# TOP Foundations Project # 2 - Landing Page
- Live page here: https://wlindstrom55.github.io/landing_page/
- The instructions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page
  - Basically you are given a picture of a page and told to replicate it, although the instructions stress to not worry too much about making things pixel perfect or nice-looking on mobile.
  - The styles are given here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png
  - The page to replicate is here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png
- Apparently there are student examples somewhere on the TOP github, I followed the advice in the instructions to not look at them.
